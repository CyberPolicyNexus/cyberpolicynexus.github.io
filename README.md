# Cyber Policy Nexus

I know what you're thinking, "Not another Slack?!" But hear me out. The cyber policy community lacks a common online space to educate each other and share expertise and ideas. To address this, we have started a Slack workspace that allows the cybersecurity policy community to congregate and collaborate. Slack provides a platform for open discussions on general topics and allows individual groups to start their own private channels for private conversations or to explore specific topics.

If you have a cyber policy role and agree to the [Rules of Engagement](https://cyberpolicynexus.org/rules), apply below.
