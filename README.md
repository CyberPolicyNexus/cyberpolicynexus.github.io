# Cyber Policy Nexus

### About the Nexus
The [Cyber Policy Nexus](https://cyberpolicynexus.org/) (or the Nexus) is a safe space online for cyber policy professionals to congregate and collaborate, to learn and educate. The Slack workspace provides a platform for open discussions on general topics and allows individual groups to start private channels for closed discussions.

Participation is contingent on adhering to the [Rules of Engagement](https://cyberpolicynexus.org/#rules) and community norms as they emerge. If you are a cyber policy professional interested in participating, submit a request through the [Signup Form](https://cyberpolicynexus.org/#signup).

### Rules of Engagement
 * While the Nexus aims to be an inclusive group, its focus is facilitating cybersecurity discussions among the global cyber policy community. For now, only those with current or former cyber policy roles are eligible to join.

 * The Nexus is a safe space for cybersecurity discussions where we want members to feel comfortable asking questions, seeking assistance, and sharing ideas. Topics and behaviors that undermine those goals are unwelcome, such as those that are partisan, political, commercial, aggressive, exclusionary, or derogatory.

 * Member transparency fosters trust and accountability. Members should create a profile that includes a) your real name, b) a description of your role, c) any relevant affiliations, d) policy areas of interest. The profile does not need to include a photo.

 * Discretion leads to greater candor. The Nexus expects members will honor the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule), *“participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed*.”
