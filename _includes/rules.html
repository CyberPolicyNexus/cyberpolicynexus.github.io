      <h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
      <p>While the Nexus aims to be an inclusive group, its focus is facilitating cybersecurity discussions among the global cyber policy community. For now, only those with current or former cyber policy roles are eligible to join.</p>
      <p>The Nexus is a safe space for cybersecurity discussions where we want members to feel comfortable asking questions, seeking assistance, and sharing ideas. Topics and behaviors that undermine those goals are unwelcome, such as those that are partisan, political, commercial, aggressive, exclusionary, or derogatory.</p>
      <p>Member transparency fosters trust and accountability. Members should create a profile that includes a) your real name, b) a description of your role, c) any relevant affiliations, d) policy areas of interest. The profile does not need to include a photo.</p>
      <p>Discretion leads to greater candor. The Nexus expects its members will honor the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a>, <em>“participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s),
          nor that of any other participant, may be revealed</em>.”</p>
